Kjelstrom & Associates was started in 1995 by Kit Kjelstrom. Kit has worked in the construction materials industry for over 38 years: allowing him to understand the operations and needs of the industry. The company was incorporated in 2008 when Shaun Kjelstrom joined the company.

Kjelstrom & Associates, Inc helps construction materials companies from ""start to finish"" on all aspects necessary to operate. “Start to finish” means that we assist in obtaining use and operational permits (start), we design process flow and engineer the structures, we project manage the construction of these facilities, and we help reclaim/revegetate the disturbed land (finish). Some of the ""start to finish"" projects we have completed have included sand and gravel mines, ready mix concrete plants, and asphalt concrete plants.

We specialize in industrial design, including site layouts, civil design, structural design, permits (e.g. Use permits, building permits), compliance documents (e.g. SWPPP, SPCC, etc.), and many other processes that require a registered engineer's oversight.

Rummel Construction, Inc. is seeking Heavy Civil Construction Project Engineers to support our projects near Tucson, Arizona.

For 25 years Rummel Construction, Inc. has been providing high quality earthmoving and heavy civil construction services throughout Arizona and the Greater Southwest. We're most well known for our capability in moving massive amounts of earth safely and efficiently, but we're also involved in work at airports, in the mining industry, transportation sector and more. We don't just manage the work of others, we do most of it ourselves. With over 600 employees and more than 300 pieces of heavy equipment, we've got the tools and experience to get the job done right.

About You

In our work, details matter. As a Project Engineer, assigned to one or more of our projects, you'll be responsible to keep track of the details. From monitoring production quantities to reviewing budgets and schedules, Project Engineers are the hub of information between the field and the office. They're ordering materials, setting up subcontractors, attending customer meetings, supporting the field superintendent and relaying crucial information back to the office. You'll find yourself in the field most days, watching the work unfold in front of you.

You'll be working on the following:

 * Creating and maintaining budgets
 * Developing Schedules
 * Processing Change Orders
 * Managing Subcontractors
 * Writing Purchase Agreements and Purchase Orders
 * Track material quantities
 * Source and order materials
 * Communicate with owners and inspectors
 * Collaborate with Rummel Project Managers and Administrative Staff

This position requires the safe operation of a company vehicle and is therefore a safety-sensitive position, and requires a clean driving record.

**This position is located in Arizona, relocation is available for candidates that are applying from out of state**

What are your Qualifications?

 * College degree in construction management, civil engineering, or a related field, preferred
 * Willing to work on projects near Tucson, Arizona
 * Excellent verbal and written communication skills
 * Strong personal organizational skills
 * Able to manage time appropriately and assign priority to your work duties

When and Where Do We Work?

We work with the sun. That means during the summer, we start earlier (think 5:30 or 6 AM). During winter we start a little later. Our business is outside, so you should be able to work effectively in all weather conditions (summer heat, winter cold, even the rainy and humid days).

Flexibility and the ability to travel, if needed, is the key. We're a regional company, so don't expect to travel out of the state very often, but expect to drive between projects and the office throughout the week.

Why Work With Us?

We are strong believers in opportunity and promotion from within our organization. We want you to be successful in your career and we want you to grow with us. We'll give you the opportunities to put in the work and provide you with the tools to be successful. All that and an excellent benefits package.

As a member of Professional Engineering Associates’ (PEA) structural department, this Structural Engineer will be integrated into some of the most exciting and challenging industrial and manufacturing projects that are currently being designed in the United States.

In recent years, PEA has developed a communication system for the integration of remote working engineers into our design workflow. PEA is accustomed to fully remote design staff; however, PEA will gladly accommodate hybrid or non-remote employees from the upstate South Carolina area who prefer an office. PEA’s current needs require a full-time, on-premises employee with the opportunity in the future to transition to a hybrid or fully remote position depending upon their gained experience and capabilities.
